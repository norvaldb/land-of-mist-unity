## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

1. **Combat Balance**: Complex interaction between classes, weapons, and magic
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive playtesting, data-driven balance adjustments
   - **Contingency**: Simplified mechanics if balance proves too complex

2. **UI Complexity**: Text-based interface must be intuitive
   - **Mitigation**: Early UI prototyping, user testing
   - **Contingency**: GUI fallback options for complex interactions

3. **Performance**: Text rendering and state management efficiency
   - **Mitigation**: Regular profiling, optimization milestones
   - **Contingency**: Feature reduction if performance targets missed

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **Save System**: Complex game state serialization
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental testing, backup systems

2. **Magic System**: Complex spell interactions and effects
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, add complexity gradually

3. **Platform Compatibility**: Multiple platform support
   - **Mitigation**: Regular testing on target platforms
