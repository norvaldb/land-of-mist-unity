## Document Templates

Each planning document should follow these guidelines:

### Game Design Documents

- **Purpose**: What aspect of the game does this address?
- **Requirements**: What must this system accomplish?
- **Design**: How will it work from a player perspective?
- **Dependencies**: What other systems does this rely on?

### Technical Documents

- **Architecture**: High-level system design
- **Implementation**: Specific technical approaches
- **Testing**: How will this be validated?
- **Performance**: Impact on game performance

### Production Documents

- **Timeline**: When will this be completed?
- **Dependencies**: What blocks or enables this work?
- **Resources**: What tools, assets, or skills are needed?
- **Risks**: What could go wrong and how to mitigate?

## Planning Workflow

1. **Document First**: Write the plan before coding
2. **Review and Iterate**: Get feedback on plans before implementation
3. **Keep Updated**: Maintain plans as the project evolves
4. **Reference During Development**: Use plans to guide implementation decisions

## Integration with Development

These planning documents directly inform:

- Code architecture following SOLID principles
- Test-driven development approach
- Performance optimization strategies
- Feature prioritization and roadmap planning

All plans should align with the architectural principles defined in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
